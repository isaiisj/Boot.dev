Assignment
Let's create an "influencer score". It will be a small number (like less than 100) that will give 
influencers a metric for comparing their social media success against their peers.

Complete the get_influencer_score function. 
An influencer score is their average engagement percentage multiplied by log base 2 of their follower count.

'''

import math


def get_influencer_score(num_followers, average_engagement_percentage):

    # Influencer score
    influencer_score = average_engagement_percentage * math.log(num_followers,2)

    return influencer_score
